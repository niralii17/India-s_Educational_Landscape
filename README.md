### [medium - article] (https://medium.com/@niraliparikh17/exploring-indias-educational-landscape-insights-from-udise-data-6b09eea5fb4e)

##  Problem Statement

This analysis explores the educational landscape in India using data from the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE). The goal is to provide insights into the number of teachers, schools, and enrollments across different states and Union Territories (UTs). The report highlights key disparities and advancements in educational infrastructure, aiming to inform policy and initiatives for educational development.

### Steps Followed

- **Step 1:** Collected data from the UDISE website, including metrics on the number of teachers, schools, and enrollments.
- **Step 2:** Cleaned the data to remove inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Step 3:** Analyzed the data to determine the percentage of functional girls' toilets, drinking water facilities, and pupil-teacher ratios by state/UT.
- **Step 4:** Created various charts and maps to visualize the data, highlighting key areas of concern and regions performing well.
- **Step 5:** Produced a report summarizing findings, including graphical representations and detailed insights.

### Key Findings

1. **Teacher Distribution:**
   - **Uttar Pradesh**: Accounts for 15.86% of the total teachers.
   - **Lakshadweep**: Contributes just 0.01% of the total teachers.

2. **Enrollment Distribution:**
   - **Uttar Pradesh**: Has 17.79% of the total enrollments.
   - **Lakshadweep**: Represents 0.01% of the total enrollments.

3. **Functional Facilities:**
   - **Girls' Toilets:** Uttar Pradesh has 253,889 total girls' toilets with 249,626 being functional.
   - **Drinking Water:** Uttar Pradesh has 255,731 total drinking water sources with 249,243 being functional.

4. **Pupil-Teacher Ratio:**
   - A map visualization was used to assess the pupil-teacher ratio across different states and UTs, providing insights into how well states manage their teacher resources relative to student populations.


### Visualizations

- **Clustered Chart:** Illustrates the distribution of teachers and enrollments across states and UTs.
- **Stacked Area Chart for Girls' Toilets:** Shows the availability of functional versus total girls' toilets by state/UT.
- **Stacked Area Chart for Drinking Water:** Depicts the availability of functional versus total drinking water sources.
- **Pupil-Teacher Ratio Map:** Displays the pupil-teacher ratio across different states and UTs.


### Insights

- **Uttar Pradesh**: Has a substantial share of teachers and enrollments due to its large population. The state also shows significant investment in school infrastructure with high numbers of functional girls' toilets and drinking water facilities.
- **Lakshadweep**: With its small population, shows minimal numbers in both teacher distribution and enrollments, reflecting its unique educational landscape.

### Conclusion

The analysis of UDISE data provides valuable insights into India's educational infrastructure. By visualizing these numbers, we gain a clearer picture of where educational resources are concentrated and where improvements are needed. Such data-driven insights are crucial for shaping effective educational policies and initiatives.
